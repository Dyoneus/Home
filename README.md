# ID-S10227735-Ong Jia Yuan-Assgnment1-Personal Portfolio
To begin of, I have chosen to create a personal portfolio for any potential collaborator or employers who may have my website piqued their interest in collaborating or looking to hire someone. I believe that by creating a personal portfolio, I am able to re-use and update frequently in the future as portfolio will always be needed to be used as a showcase for yourself.  

# Design Process
The design that I have chosen for my portfolio. In order to create an immediate interest to form a high opinion of my website, I have decided to went for a simplified aesthetic homepage design. I have chosen simplicity to facilitate seamless communication between the eyes and the brain, allowing user to process information quickly and effectively. In the mainpage, I have a gif which invoke an emotion and being visually appealing contents, I tried to dive into our user mind as they browse through my website on how effective can I relay my information to. In order for me to come up with some ideas, I tried to look into various perspective of my users:

- As a user, I would like to navigate through the website easily to view different contents.
- As a user, I would like to be able to have multi-compatibiity such as surfing the website using phone, computer or other electronic devices.
- As a user, I would like to contact the person of this website using contact information provided in the website.
- As a user, I would like to know the contents provided in the website with no design complesity.
